## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the SaaS Blueprint Generator Platform, an advanced MVP that transforms SaaS ideas into comprehensive visual blueprints and implementation plans.

### 1.2 Scope
The SaaS Blueprint Generator Platform is designed to help entrepreneurs, product managers, and development teams quickly validate SaaS ideas and create structured plans for implementation. The platform leverages AI to provide idea validation, feature recommendations, tech stack suggestions, user flow diagrams, and project management tools.

### 1.3 Product Overview
Users input their SaaS idea and description into the platform and receive an AI-generated visual blueprint that provides guidance for developing their website or application. The platform validates the idea, suggests improvements, defines core features, recommends appropriate technology stacks, generates user flow diagrams, creates Kanban cards for task management, and offers a project overview with progress tracking. Additionally, it integrates an AI agent (MCP, powered by Cursor AI) to automate ticket management and assist with code generation.

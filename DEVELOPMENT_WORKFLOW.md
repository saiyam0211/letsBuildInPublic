## 🔄 Development Workflow (GitFlow-style)

### 1. 🚀 Starting New Work

```bash
# Always start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch for new work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Feature Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/user-authentication`
- `feature/blueprint-generator`
- `feature/ai-integration`
- `feature/database-schema`
- `feature/frontend-ui`

### 2. 💻 Development Cycle

```bash
# Work on your feature
# Make atomic commits as you progress
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user login functionality"

# Push feature branch (creates it on GitHub)
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. 🔍 Code Review & Integration

```bash
# Create PR: feature branch → develop
gh pr create --base develop \
  --title "Add user authentication" \
  --body "Description of changes, testing notes, etc."



# GitHub automatically assigns @saiyam0211 as reviewer (CODEOWNERS)
# Review, approve, and merge through GitHub UI
```

### 4. 🚢 Release Preparation

```bash
# When develop is stable and ready for production
# Create PR: develop → main
gh pr create --base main \
  --title "Release v1.0.0" \
  --body "Production release with features X, Y, Z"

# After thorough testing, merge to main
# This becomes your production release
```
